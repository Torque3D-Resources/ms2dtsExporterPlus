<h1>Comment Strings</h1>

<p id=COMMENTS_OVERVIEW>Versions of milkshape before 1.7.4 did not provide any means of storing additional user information in the model. The original ms2dtsExporter stored a small number of properties in the name of the mesh or material. eg. seq:walk=1-4,cyclic. Previous versions of ms2dtsExporterPlus continued this practice, although because there were far more properties to store, they were packed into a binary form, resulting in names that looked like this: *Walk=@!]!!!?&!b!!.</p>

<p>All user properties are now stored in the comment string of the model, mesh and material objects. There are 3 types of properties, floating point, integer and boolean (true/false). Each group stores the number of properties in that group, then a list of name=value pairs, each on a new line.</p>

<p>eg. The comment string of an animation sequence may look like this:</p>

<pre>
1
frameRate=30
4
endFrame=4
startFrame=1
numTriggers=1
triggerFrame0=1
triggerState0=-1
1
cyclic=1
</pre>

<p>Comment strings can be edited manually, but very little validation is performed when they are read by the exporter, so manual editing should be avoided. The export dialog boxes provide a much better way to edit object properties.</p>
